# LIME-XAI
This repository explores Explainable AI using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations). It applies LIME on trained black-box models to interpret predictions, identify influential features, and improve transparency. The project includes two case studies demonstrating how model decisions can be understood and validated.
